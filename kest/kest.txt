1. Create the users Serena Williams, Venus Williams and Justine Henin, all of them
with password set to stargate, with username (lower case!) as their first name, and
their full name in the comment. Verify that the users and their home directory are
properly created.

useradd -m -c "Serena Williams" serena ; passwd serena
useradd -m -c "Venus Williams" venus ; passwd venus
useradd -m -c "Justine Henin" justine ; passwd justine
tail /etc/passwd ; tail /etc/shadow ; ls /home
Keep user logon names in lowercase!

2. Create a user called kornuser, give him the Korn shell (/bin/ksh) as his default
shell. Log on with this user (on a command line or in a tty).

useradd -s /bin/ksh kornuser ; passwd kornuser

3. Create a user named einstime without home directory, give him /bin/date as his
default logon shell. What happens when you log on with this user ? Can you think of
a useful real world example for changing a user's login shell to an application ?

useradd -s /bin/date einstime ; passwd einstime

4. Try the commands who, whoami, who am i, w, id, echo $USER $UID .

who ; whoami ; who am i ; w ; id ; echo $USER $UID 

5a. Lock the venus user account with usermod.

usermod -L venus

5b. Use passwd -d to disable the serena password. Verify the serena line in /etc/

grep serena /etc/shadow; passwd -d serena ; grep serena /etc/shadow

shadow before and after disabling.
5c. What is the difference between locking a user account and disabling a user
account's password ?

Locking will prevent the user from logging on to the system with his password (by putting
a ! in front of the password in /etc/shadow). Disabling with passwd will erase the password
from /etc/shadow.

6. As root change the password of einstime to stargate.

Log on as root and type: passwd einstime

7. Now try changing the password of serena to serena as serena.

log on as serena, then execute: passwd serena
8. Make sure every new user needs to change his password every 10 days.

For an existing user: chage -M 10 serena
For all new users: vi /etc/login.defs (and change PASS_MAX_DAYS to 10)

9. Set the warning number of days to four for the kornuser.

chage -W 4 kornuser

10a. Set the password of two separate users to stargate. Look at the encrypted
stargate's in /etc/shadow and explain.

If you used passwd, then the salt will be different for the two encrypted passwords.

10b. Take a backup as root of /etc/shadow. Use vi to copy an encrypted stargate to
another user. Can this other user now log on with stargate as a password ?

Yes.

11. Put a file in the skeleton directory and check whether it is copied to user's home
directory. When is the skeleton directory copied ?

When you create a user account with a new home directory.

12. Why use vipw instead of vi ? What could be the problem when using vi or vim ?

vipw will give a warning when someone else is already using
that file.

13. Use chsh to list all shells, and compare to cat /etc/shells. Change your login shell
to the Korn shell, log out and back in. Now change back to bash.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux: chsh -l
On Debian/Ubuntu: cat /etc/shells

14. Which useradd option allows you to name a home directory ?

-d
15. How can you see whether the password of user harry is locked or unlocked ? Give a solution with grep and a solution with passwd.

grep harry /etc/shadow
passwd -S harry

16. Create the groups tennis, football and sports.

Sudo Addgroup tennis
Sudo Addgroup football
Sudo Addgroup sports

17. In one command, make venus a member of tennis and sports.

 Sudo usermod -a -G tennis,sports venus

18. Rename the football group to foot.

Sudo Groupmod -n foot football

19. Use vi to add serena to the tennis group.

vi /etc/group

20. Use the id command to verify that serena is a member of tennis. 

id
